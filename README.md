# Mirrage
Website built as a part of an internship at Asilverse, primarily using ReactJS, Firebase, npm, nodeJS, and vanilla JS. <br/>
The website is designed around the concept of BioRhythms, and provides users with a set of tracks depending on their BioRhythms in 5 different attributes on any given day. Users also have the option to select activities and play tunes recommended for those activities, as well as view graphs on projected daily and monthly BioRhythm patterns. Authentication for Google,email and facebook signup was implemented using FirebaseAuth. Tunes for each attribute and activities, along with the authenticated users, are stored in Cloud Firestore and Authentication DBs respectively.  <br/>
The variants of the website I worked on are present in the Develop and softLaunch branch.The website is hosted on Netlify at the following link, and represents the state of the website in the softLaunch branch:<br/>
